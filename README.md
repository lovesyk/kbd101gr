# kbd101gr
## Description
kbd101gr is a Windows keyboard layout file mapping the Japanese onto the German keyboard.

This layout has several advantages over the plain German kbdgr layout:

  * kana input is possible using the same layout as on US keyboards
  * IME shortcuts involving NLS keys are working
  * dead keys are disabled as they are not supported by Japanese input

This layout does not solve all remaining issues:

  * redirecting the layout file to this one is still a modification that can be overwritten by any update or Windows repair
  * dead keys are still not working and hence disabled at least
  * IME's letter capturing still breaks on e. g. the control + alt modifier
  
As an addition it is possible to enter Â¥ using control + alt + y.

## Install
On 64-bit systems, copy the contents of the extracted archive into your Windows directory.

On 32-bit systems, copy the DLL from the SysWOW64 directory of the extracted archive into your System32 directory.

Redirect the Japanese kbdjpn layout to kbd101gr by browsing to the 
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layouts\00000411` registry key
and changing the `Layout File` value to `kbd101gr.dll`.

Log out and back in and the new layout will be applied.
